# Welcome to Homework 7 By Monica Morrison

The purpose of this project is to help a company create a database that represents a company-wide resume that holds skills, employees (people), and roles. This will allow the company to easily access employees with specific skills, list the skills of any employee, and find gaps in skills sets of employees in specific roles. There are lists of various queries written in this file using the database created within the .sql file.

This folder contains three files: hw7-ddl.sql, hw7.html, and hw7.qmd. 

* The hw7.qmd file contains the source code for the assignment.

* The hw7.html file contains a rendered version of the QMD file and uploaded to Canvas for review.

* The hw7-ddl.sql file contains SQL statements for creating and inserting data.
